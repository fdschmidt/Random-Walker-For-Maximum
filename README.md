# Random Walker For Maximum

A Jupyter Notebook that determines the maximum of a function (1D or 2D) by using a basic random walker.

## Describtion
The code can determine the maximum of either a one-dimensional or a two-dimensional function using either a random walker algorithm or a slightly modified random walker.

The random walker algorithm will generate a specific number of random x value and calculate the corresponding f(x). If the new f(x) value is larger than the previously determined largest f(x) value, the maximum will be updated. A second routine will determine whether the random walker algorithm converged within the given number of steps. Finally, the result is plotted as a grap for the 1D case or a map for the 2D case.

The modified random walker algorithm introduces a chance variable which will randomly accept a new sample point, even if it's not a maxima, to help escape local maxima.
